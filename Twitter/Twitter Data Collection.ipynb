    "The code in this notebook is for gathering tweets regarding types of wine. We plan to gain insight into the UK population's wine preferences based on the frequency with which each category of wine is mentioned in the past week's tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems during data collection\n",
    "1. When filtering the tweets by geolocation there were very few tweets from the UK in the last week. \n",
    "2. The order of the key terms in the request affects the resulting tweets.\n",
    "3. There were instances in the resulting tweets which did not mention exactly what we were looking for i.e. wrong context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions to the problems identified\n",
    "1. We decided to remove the location filter and assume that all English speakers have the same preferences.\n",
    "2. We repeated the tweet request four times, with each wine category in the first position once, and used all that data to obtain the ranking of the categories.\n",
    "3. When iterating through the tweets to count the number of times each category was mentioned, we ensured in our code such cases did not yield a count, hence cleaning the data in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in retrieving the tweets\n",
    "1. Access the Twitter API\n",
    "2. Decide on the key search terms and how many tweets to retrieve considering the limit\n",
    "3. Do this for all 4 search combinations:\n",
    "    - Create a dictionary with empty lists to pass the tweets in\n",
    "    - Collect original tweets (no retweets) written in English and starting with red wine in terms\n",
    "    - Create a for loop that iterates through all the words in the text and identifies the instances where red wine, white wine, sparkling wine and rose wine are mentioned and gives a point to each category based on that.\n",
    "    - Add the points to the corresponding empty list in the dictionary and pass the dictionary into a dataframe\n",
    "    - Save as CSV to conduct analysis on the specific tweets you retrieved, otherwise results would change every moment as new tweets are made"
